 * Interface for the entity tree
 *
 * The entity tree describe an object (a couse, a activityn a question) with all it's dependencies
 *      (for exemple, choices for a question, questions of a category modules of a section of a course)
 * See the documentation of the API to have precises exemples.
 *
 * All classes in the tree describing an entity (a question, an activity, etc...) must conform to this interface
 * The tree nodes can be :
 *      - an object of class entity or an inherited class (in classes/entities) : an row of a table (and subtrees)
 *              so, it's decribed by a table name, and an id in this table
 *      - an object of class entities : it's a list of objects entity (with his own tree)
 *              for exemple sections of a course is a node "entities" of the course entity
 *      - an object of class field : it's a field of row of a table
 *              (a table name, an id, a field name, and the value of field)
 *      - an objet of the class value : it's a node or a subtree directly inserted,
 *              without direct attachement to the database
